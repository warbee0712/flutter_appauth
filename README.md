# flutter_appauth

A Flutter bridge for AppAuth

## Getting Started

Please see the example that demonstrates how to sign in with Google auth using the same credentials as the AppAuth code lab by Google. More documentation and details to come soon.

**NOTE**: this library uses AndroidX and there is currently a known issuer with Jetifier that affects the use of Chrome Custom Tabs. This means that until a fix for it is released, signing will direct users to the browser as opposed to using Chrome Custom Tabs.
